# COSC541-Project
The project files provided include 2 html files. The fullscreen.html is the file I provided the participantsto test the app. 
The preview.html is the file that can be run natively, i used that file for the the participants who were not able to load the fullscreen.html file.
The file opens in the proto.io prototype preview mode.
The preview.html file can be set up natively, and for this file all the other files are provided to load these files natively whithout need for any highspeed network connection.
All the data to load the prewiew.html file is saved in the src folder.
The prototype was made in proto.io, it was mainly designed using its features, only the connections of the files (setting up the interaction between the different screens and the buttons) was sometimes done via html commands.
The collected data from the participant's was mainly form the interview notes I had taken the other formal data that I collected was via the questionnaire. That file is also attached in the data.csv name.
